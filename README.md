# Protocol-for-deriving-longitudinal-Clinical-Outcomes-from-electronic-health-records

This repository is a summary of all the resources and tools that includes in this protocol: Protocol for deriving longitudinal Clinical Outcomes from electronic health records.

## Contents

## Description and flowchart

In this protocol, we are going to present a method to capture longitudinal clinical outcomes from structured and unstructured electronic health record based on the the high-throughput **M**ultimodal **A**utomated **P**henotyping **(MAP)** algorithm and **LA**bel efficien**T** inciden**T** ph**E**notyping **(LATTE)** algorithm . The result, which is the qualified clinical outcomes can be used to harness electronic health data to real-world data. The protocol is generally made up by 4 steps:

1)  Creating EHR Data mart;
2)  Selecting codified and narrative features with ONCE, compiling and performing the MAP algorithm;
3)  Preparing data for LATTE algorithm;
4)  Performing the LATTE to get longitudinal outcome.

## Method

### Step 1: Creating EHR Data mart

The EHR Data mart is the basic component of the protocol, it consists both the codified data and narrative data.

##### Compiling Variable Dictionary

The raw EHR data includes a great amount of information, and many of them do not need to be involve in our study taken both confidentiality and storage availability under consideration. We need a variable dictionary for our specific study on the target disease. The shiny app ONCE can help us derive the relative codified features(PheCode, CCS, LOINC, RxNorm) and narrative features(relative CUIs and terms) .

##### Aggregating codified data

##### Processing narrative data

We will extract the NLP mentions from the free-text clinical notes and map them into the Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).

##### Summarizing

The result of the codified data aggregation and narrative data processing will be aggregated longitudinally into monthly counts for each patient from the onset time.

## Step 2: Phenotyping

We are going to use high-throughput **M**ultimodal **A**utomated **P**henotyping **(MAP)** algorithm to complete the phenotyping. MAP is a algorithm used to predict the probability of the patient having a certain outcome (eg: target disease) based on the counts of ICD codes, NLP mentions, and visits. The MAP will automatically generate a threshold based on the data. The details of MAP can be found in [High-throughput multimodal automated phenotyping (MAP) with application to PheWAS](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article-abstract/26/11/1255/5544731)
