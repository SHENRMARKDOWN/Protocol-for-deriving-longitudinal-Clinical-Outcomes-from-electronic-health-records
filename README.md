This repository is a summary of all the resources and tools that includes in this protocol: Protocol for deriving longitudinal Clinical Outcomes from electronic health records.

##Contents


##Discription and flowchart
In this protocol, we are going to present a method to capture longitudinal clinical outcomes from structured and unstructured electronic health record based on the the high-throughput **M**ultimodal **A**utomated **P**henotyping **(MAP)** algorithm and **LA**bel efficien**T** inciden**T** ph**E**notyping **(LATTE)** algorithm . The result, which is the qualified clinical outcomes can be used to harness electronic health data to real-world data. The protocol is generally made up by 4 steps:

1) Creating EHR Data mart; 
2) Selecting codified and uncodified features with ONCE, compiling and performing the MAP algorithm; 
3) Preparing data for LATTE algorithm;
4) Performing the LATTE to get longitudinal outcome.
